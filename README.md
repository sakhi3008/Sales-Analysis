# Sales-Analysis
# üß≠ Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project is to analyze sales and financial data to generate actionable business insights that support strategic decision-making. By exploring key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue trends, profitability, customer behavior, and discount impacts, the dashboard enables stakeholders to identify growth opportunities, control expenses, and optimize financial performance.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tool Used
Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning, pivot tables, dynamic dashboard creation, financial formulas, and data visualization.

# üìà Key Concepts Applied
Total Sales: Measures total revenue from transactions.

Total Profit: Difference between revenue and cost; shows business health.

Profit Margin: Profit as a percentage of sales, used to assess efficiency.

Discount Impact: Analyzed how discounts affect both sales volume and profit.

Customer Segmentation: Identified top and bottom performing customers.

Year-over-Year (YoY) Comparison: Compared revenue and profit across different years.

Trend Analysis: Used line charts to understand seasonal or monthly patterns.

KPI Cards: Highlighted current performance metrics such as Total Sales, Profit, and Discount %.

# ‚åê DAX Measures and Calculated Columns

Several custom DAX measures were created to provide enhanced insights:

Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales Amount])

Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])

Discount % = DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Discount Amount]), SUM(Sales[Sales Amount]))

Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])

YoY Sales Growth = ([Current Year Sales] - [Previous Year Sales]) / [Previous Year Sales]

Additional time intelligence functions were used to evaluate YoY comparisons and month-to-date trends.

# üìå Insights & Recommendations

High Discounts ‚Üí Lower Profitability
Excessive discounting often led to reduced margins without a proportional increase in sales volume.

Top 10 Customers = Majority of RevenueA 
small group of customers contributed the majority of total revenue, suggesting the need for loyalty initiatives or premium services.

Seasonal Sales Trends Identified
Specific months showed consistently higher sales, hinting at marketing opportunities during those periods.

Unprofitable Products Detected
Some products sold in high volume but had very low or negative profit margins. These may need price adjustment or bundling strategies.

Regional Disparities in Sales
Sales were concentrated in certain regions, indicating opportunities to expand or replicate success in underperforming regions.
